Notes based on Kubernetes: Up & Running  by Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower and Lachlan Evenson

Kubernetes enables the the following pillars of Software in production:
- **Velocity** : Moving from static pillar-like software shipped in CDs to over-the-network delivery of software and incremental updates. (This draws parallels with moving from a once a year iteration of software that we have to pay for every time we buy a version to subscription based software) Meh not sure I like it. So basically it is the number of feature we can ship while maintaining uninterrupted service. 
- **Scaling** : It decouples components from each other so that each component can be scaled up or down based on requirements
